  <p>Today is the first day of the 3rd week of quarantine. It's been extended through the end of April.
      Life is weird. There's no one outside. Going to the grocery store means risking illness. There seems to be
      a crazy sense of togetherness online though and it's been getting me through. I love the random free in home
      concerts and DNICE DJ sets. It's definitely lonely but it's going to be okay. Ordered Buy 1 Get 1 Free 
      Chipotle burrito bowls. life is okay.

    <p>I am sick of being in this apartment. All of my neighbors are a mess. The people upstairs are so loud, 
        The people next door are always playing instruments. The weather is starting to get nice, I just want to go outside.
        I also want to go grocery shopping and not feel like im going to die. Some positives: Im healthy, I bought starburst jelly beans,
        I am going to dye eggs and make a nice Easter dinner, I finally have time to relax a bit.

        I'm actually terrible at keeping up with this. 
        <br>
        It's been exactly a month and not too much has changed. It seems like the death rate is steadily decreasing. 
        Positive cases don't seem to be exponentially increasing anymore. Everything is still closed with the exception of grocery stores, 
        banks and other random places. My motivation at this time is virtually non-exisitent but small victory, I've
        finally been able to do some organization from moving way back in October! 
        <br>
        other positives: cooking is fun, I still love walking around the neighborhood and parks, the weather is getting 
        nice, Animal Crossing, & I saw my parents 2 weeks ago!
        <br>
        Im craving: brunch, Homegoods, a good night out, going to the movies, seeing my friends, being in the office, 
        hugs, planning hypothetical vacations. 
        <br> 
        Going forward my goal is to practice coding, continue decorating and putting things away, i WILL keep my room clean &
        free from clutter, and I want to get more exercise.
